  <h3>In America children do not have truly helpful after school programs. Children espically older ones do not have anywhere to go leading them into trouble. Most of this stems from steep prices resulting in many programs. The goal is to open free and low cost programs with real wide varities of activities and intrestes for kids. </h3>

After school over the years left school and went private with limited space and high prices parents won't be paying for multiple kids. This resulted in many kids being left to get themselves hom at young ages and allowed older kids to be out until their parents come home.</p>

      <p>In order for children and parents to want and activally go to after school programs the government would haveto pay for high quality diverse programs for students that are free and truly helpful in things like schoolwork, socializing, and childrens interests. This would be incrediably helpful to children in low income areas who need guidance after school.</p>
